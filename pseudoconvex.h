 * Fills a patch with respectively 6-p break edges. The number of threes between each of the consequent break edges

 * current contains a pointer to the new fragment of the extended spiral that needs to be determined by this method.
 * The integer shellCounter contains the number of faces that still need to be added to complete the current shell.
 * currentShell contains a pointer to the current shell that is being filled.
 * The integer shellStart indicates which of the breakedges corresponds to the first break edge that was started from
 * to start filling the current shell. (0 means the break edge before k1, ...)
 *
 * The booleans p(_i) are used for IPR reasons. It indicates whether a pentagon is allowed at the ith break-edge.
 * In the case of 0 pentagons left, we can't add anymore pentagons, so there is no need to keep track of this at that point.
 * The boolean lastWasPi is also used for IPR reasons. It indicates whether the previous operation was a P(i) operation.
